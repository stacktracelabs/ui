# Introduction

A component library built on the top of [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) for Laravel, Vue and Inertia.
The library contains all components which can be found in [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/), and also some custom components
crafted by us, which we often use in our applications.

The library is built specifically for Laravel and Inertia, hence it is provided as composer package, not as a npm package. You install it
as a dependency, and it is part of the application you are building.

Besides core [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) components, the library provides some custom components, which are made
for use with Laravel and Inertia, which depends on some backend logic included in the package, for example the [Data Table](/components/data-table) component.

All UI components are part of the application code, and you can customize look and behavior the same way as [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) components.
