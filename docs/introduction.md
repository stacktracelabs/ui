# Introduction

This component library is built on top of [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) and tailored specifically for Laravel, Vue, and Inertia.js. It includes all the components available in [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/), along with custom components we’ve created and frequently use in our applications.

Designed for seamless integration with Laravel and Inertia, this library is provided as a Composer package instead of an npm package. You can install it as a dependency, making it a core part of the application you’re developing.

In addition to the core [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) components, the library offers custom components specifically designed to work with Laravel and Inertia, some of which rely on backend logic included in the package. For example, the [Data Table](/components/data-table) component.

All UI components are integrated directly into your application code, allowing you to easily customize their appearance and behavior in the same way you would with [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) components.
